## PSQL XAPI Tracker
This Java application is used to track notifications from a PSQL database and build xAPI statements from them.
The statements are then transferred to a specified Learning Record Store (As part of the Thesis, a Learning Locker instance [TBA URL]).
Specifically, it is designed to work with an altered version of the Gamification-Frameworks PSQL database [TBA Ref],
although any other PSQL database would work, provided it creates notifications in a suitable format.
